Water Crisis in Maji Ndogo Report:

I am pleased to present to you this comprehensive report on the water crisis in Maji Ndogo, through which I answered some questions that contribute to solving the problem.

The report outlines the main points of the survey carried out by the team, giving a general understanding of the water problem in Maji Ndogo.
The most important of these points are:
- Only, approximately, 34% of the population of Maji Ndogo have access to basic water service.
- While 66% of the population finds difficulties in accessing basic water service.
- The total budget needed to make improvements is approximately $147 million, divided among the five provinces.

There is also a detailed report for each province showing the provinceâ€™s population, the improvements required for each water source, as well as the budget needed to complete these improvements.

I enjoyed working on this project, which gave me great experience in analyzing data, paying attention to details, understanding the problem, and focusing on finding a solution to it.
